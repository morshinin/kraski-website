Troubles

IE not showing fonts
  included eot fonts for ie

IE doesn't show background icons properly

chrome and firefox on mac different padding in catalogue buttons
    SOLVED
      removed top and bottom padding from anchor and set height instead
      then set margin-bottom for list items, and set line-height for anchor
      and span element inside it for the vertical align sake

background-position-y not working properly in firefox on mac
    SOLVED
      position-y went from IE, Google copied it, Firefox doesn't,
      what needed is set that way background-position: x y;
