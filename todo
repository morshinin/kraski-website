Troubles

chrome and firefox on mac different padding in catalogue buttons
    SOLVED
      removed top and bottom padding from anchor and set height instead
      then set margin-bottom for list items, and set line-height for anchor
      and span element inside it for the vertical align sake

background-position-y not working properly in firefox on mac
